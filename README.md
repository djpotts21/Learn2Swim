## About The Author [@djpotts21](https://github.com/djpotts21)
I have worked as a web designer for several years in both in-house companies and agencies producing websites. During this time, I have used WordPress and various WordPress builders to build my websites.

Having worked with WordPress since 2011, I am very confident in my ability to build websites using WordPress. Through the Code Institute, I am currently pursuing a Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development through the goal of expanding my knowledge and fine-tuning my HTML, CSS, and JS skills.
