I have worked as a web designer for several years in both in-house companies and agencies producing websites. During this time, I have used WordPress and various WordPress builders to build my websites.

Having worked with WordPress since 2011, I am very confident in my ability to build websites using WordPress. Through the Code Institute, I am currently pursuing a Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development through the goal of expanding my knowledge and fine-tuning my HTML, CSS, and JS skills.

## Bugs & Fixes

1. Classes Images on home page were streching out of ratio.
   1. FIX: After some research the css property of object-fit was used to set the image to cover so the image ratio would remain at 1:1. Thanks to [W3schools - CSS The object-fit Property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_object-fit.asp#:~:text=contain%20%2D%20The%20image%20keeps%20its,will%20be%20clipped%20to%20fit)
2. Timetable page - Tables were running off page on mobile view. If I reduced the content size to fit width of device, it would be unreadable.
   1. Fix: I split the table in to three sections for mobile and created two classes which the displayed the desktop table class only on the desktop view and hiding the mobile tables. Whilst on mobile hiding the desktop tables but displaying the split table on mobiles.
