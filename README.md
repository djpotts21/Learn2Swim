A responsive website built in Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. The website and company are fictious and have been created for the purpose of Project/Milestone 1 'User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project' of the Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development. The company, address, logo and information contained on the website are fictious.

## About The Author [@djpotts21](https://github.com/djpotts21)

I have worked as a web designer for several years in both in-house companies and agencies producing websites. During this time, I have used WordPress and various WordPress builders to build my websites.

Having worked with WordPress since 2011, I am very confident in my ability to build websites using WordPress. Through the Code Institute, I am currently pursuing a Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development through the goal of expanding my knowledge and fine-tuning my HTML, CSS, and JS skills.
